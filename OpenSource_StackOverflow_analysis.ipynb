    "The focus of study was to analyze where the most open source contributors come from and what is ther employment status. As a next step, we looked into importance of open source contribution for hiring process as well as into possible impact of open source contribution on salary and career satisfaction. It was identified that around one third of all respondents contribute to open source. The majority of the respondents come from the United Stated, India and Germany. The majority of open source contributors work full-time but contribution to open source is more prevalent among part-time employees and contractors. It is important to note that open source contributors are highly biased when it comes to hiring: they view contribution as a very important factor for a hiring decision whereas for the majority of the respondents it is only somewhat important. Even though contribution to open source may not have a major impact on hiring decision, it has an impact on career and salary satisfaction: those that contribute to open source tend to be more satisfied with their career and to earn more."
