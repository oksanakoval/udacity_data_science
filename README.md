## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to explore how prevalent contribution to open source across developers. The following questions were adressed in the analysis

1. What share of respondents contributes to open source?
2. Developers from which countries contribute to open source the most?
3. What is the employment status of open source contributors?
4. How important is contribution to open source for hiring decision? Is there any bias among contributors towards importance of open source contribution for hiring decision? 
5. Does contribution to open source impact career satisfaction and salary?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the questions were enriched with the corresponding analysis as well as visualizations.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in the GitHub post available at the repository [here](https://medium.com/@oksana.p.koval/how-contribution-to-open-source-impacts-hiring-and-career-satisfaction-78ef38574a19).
